# unit-1-homework

This weeks homework assignment was to refactor a webpage template. I altered spacing and semantic order for HTML elements, as well as added a few accessability features with image alt tags. CSS needed to boiled down and reoragnized. Grouped a lot of solo selectors and changed to a semantic ordering sturcture that more closely followed the page structure.
